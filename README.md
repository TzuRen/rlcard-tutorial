# rlcard-tutorial
In this tutorial for rlcard, we provide some toy exmples in the versions of Python and R. To simplify the implementation process and make it easier for beginners, we made it in Jupyter Notebook and Colab. Now you can train your first rlcard model with barely installation and setup. Have fun with your first trained rlcard!
